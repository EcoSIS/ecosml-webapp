      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>EcoSML is part of the <a href="https://cce.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/cce/cce_profile.pl?project_group_id=3766" target="_blank">EcoSIS Toolkit</a>, 
        which is funded by NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office ESTO) 
        through the Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) Program (Grant Number: 80NSSC17K0244).</p>

      <p>The EcoSIS Toolkit is an extension of <a href="https://ecosis.org" target="_blank">EcoSIS.org</a>, 
        which is online open-source database of ecologically 
        oriented spectral measurements and associated metadata such as leaf or plant morphological and chemical 
        measurements. EcoSIS is a repository to store your spectral data for distribution to the larger scientific 
        community, as required by granting agencies and journals. EcoSIS enables data discovery and integration 
        across datasets through a web-based search or an API. EcoSIS provides contributors with a DOI to enable 
        long-term archiving and accessibility.</p>

      <p>EcoSML.org is part of the EcoSIS Toolkit. EcoSML stand for the EcoSIS Spectral Model Library. One of the 
        major uses of spectral data such as you might find in EcoSIS is the development of spectral models to 
        predict vegetation traits such as leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, water content or nitrogen 
        concentration.  <b>EcoSML is meant to be a repository for the spectral models that people use to 
        predict variables of interest from spectral data</b> (spectral data can include image, canopy  (proximal) 
        or leaf level data). EcoSML provides both coefficients (e.g., for models built using partial least-squares 
        regression, PLSR) and code needed by users to apply a spectral model to their data.</p>

      <p>Researchers provide details and resources to create model packages that include coefficients, error parameters, 
        demonstration data, and code. Users will be able to browse models, explore example code, and test outputs. Model 
        packages will be installable via common package managers like Python's PyPI/pip, as well as R's CRAN.</p>

      <p>
          EcoSML accommodates any model forms that can be imbedded in code. At present this includes PLSR and Gaussian 
          Process Models, and will be expanded to accept other model formats.

      <div>EcoSML’s primary objectives:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Serve as a widely-accessible online repository where researchers can offer spectroscopy-derived models to 
          the science community</li>
        <li>Provide a robust API that allows direct links with EcoSIS.org, and various open-source software or 
          desktop softwares users may have.
          </li>
      </ul>
