      <div><a href="https://cce.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/cce/cce_profile.pl?project_group_id=3766">EcoSIS Toolkit abstract</a></div>

      <p>EcoSML.org is part of the EcoSIS Toolkit. Currently under development, EcoSML 
        is planned to be a database of models for retrieving ecologically-relevant 
        information from field spectroscopy data and hyperspectral imagery.</p>

      <p>Researchers will provide details and resources to create model packages 
        that include coefficients, error parameters, demonstration data, and code. 
        Users will be able to browse models, explore example code, and test outputs. 
        Model packages will be installable via common package managers like Python's 
        PyPI/pip, as well as R's CRAN.</p>
        <p>Initially, EcoSML will accommodate model forms including Partial Least Squares 
        Regression and Gaussian Process Models, and will be expanded to accept other 
        model formats in the future.</p>

      <div>EcoSML has two major objectives:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Serve as a widely-accessible online repository where researchers can offer 
          spectroscopy-derived models to the science community</li>
        <li>provide a robust API that allows direct links with EcoSIS.org, and desktop 
          software like SpecDAL, HyTools, or other custom open-source software</li>
      </ul>
